# Co-simulation of an electric vehicle powered by fuel cells and supercapacitors

The Hybrid Hydrogen Car (h2car) project aims to create personal electric vehicles powered by both fuel cells and supercapacitors. 
These vehicles must be suitable for transport in urban and peri-urban areas with reduced consumption compared to other EVs on the market. 
Beyond the coupling of the two energy sources, the project seeks to create a smart management of the fuel cell and the supercapacitors by sharing power according to the energy demand of the vehicle.

The implemented co-simulation project of such vehicles includes
- Modeling of the EV (Mechanical & Electrical models)
- Integration of GPS traces to account for road profiles
- Optimization of the energy sources
- Co-Simulation of all the subsystems (vehicle model, trajectory model, energy source model)
